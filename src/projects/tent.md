### Traditional Tent Fumigation

Traditional Tent fumigation is an all inclusive treatment type against dry wood termites. We essentially bag your entire home, building or business. Tent fumigation is so effective that it is extremely rare to have recurring termite problems because it will most likely eliminate 100% of dry wood termites. We use Vakane gas when other termite companies use cheaper, inferior and less effective gas products.

Nowadays tent fumigation is much less evasive or as inconvenient for the customer as it once was. Because we use Vakane gas you will not need to clean your floors, wash your dishes, or wash your clothes after the tent fumigation. Captain Termite Control can thoroughly explain the process to you and will offer you tips and pointers to prepare you for fumigation. We will also provide you with free bags for your food.
