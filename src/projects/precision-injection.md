# Precision Injection

Precision injection is a spot treatment where we inject Premise II or Termidor directly into the wood that contains termite colonies. We basically fill the tunnels in the wood that the colony has created and fill them up. After spot treatments a coat of Bora-Care is sprayed over the wood.

Because this a localized treatment type homeowners can be home while we work. It only takes a couple of hours for our experienced specialist to finish.

Borate treatments can be painted, sprayed, or foamed onto untreated raw wood. This is a great application for wood boring insects because of how well it penetrates (up to 4 inches) and will last the lifetime of the wood.
