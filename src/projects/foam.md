### Foam Treatment

You can agree that the worst place to get termites is inside your walls where they can't be seen. Our termite specialist carefully drills a 1/16th hole in between the studs of your wall. Then pushes the soapy foam Borate treatment as it soaks into the sides of the studs. This treatment is effective at protecting the insides of the walls making a protective alternative to traditional tenting.
