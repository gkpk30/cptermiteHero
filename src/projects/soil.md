### Soil Treatment


You can't tent fumigate against subterranean termites and their branching colonies. Our specialists will crawl underneath your home or carefully drill through the slab to create a protective barrier around the perimeter and underneath your home. Think of it as a protective moat around the exterior of the house specifically targeting subterranean termites. The months of February and March marks the beginning of subterranean termite season.
